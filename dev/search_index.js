The figures in the table above are from [Kalluri18] (Table 1) and probably represent the downlinked bit depth.The ABI … samples the radiance … of the Earth in sixteen spectral bands using several arrays of detectors at 14-bit quantization. For Earth scenes, the least significant bits are discarded since they are typically pure noise. This is done to achieve compression efficiency without sacrificing radiometric fidelity to minimize the overall data rate. For each band, the number of bits downlinked (11 to 14) is chosen such that the value of the least significant bit downlinked is less than half the maximum permitted Noise-Equivalent change in Radiance (NEdN) for that band (Table 1). This means that, for a scene of nominal radiance (100% albedo or 300 K), quantization noise is not the dominant contributor to Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) or Noise-Equivalent delta Temperature (NEdT) (unless the actual SNR or NEdT is significantly better than the requirement).[Schmit17] statesThe number of bits per pixel (radiometric resolution) is also improved on the ABI (12 for most bands; 14 for the 3.9-μm band)and [Schmit18] repeatsThere are 12 bits per pixel for all ABI band imagery files except for ABI band 7 (3.9 μm), which has 14 bits per pixelThe description of the L1b products [GOESRPUG3] list different bit depths in Table 5.1.3.6.3-1 and states in section 5.1.3.5The bit depth of the Radiances product, 10 to 14 bits, is band dependent, and is based on the bit depth of the downlinked samples from the ABI coupled with optimization considerations for GRB transmission.","category":"page"},{"location":"data/#Image-Data-Packet-Format","page":"Data","title":"Image Data Packet Format","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"data/","page":"Data","title":"Data","text":"<table>\n  <!-- <caption>Image Data Packet Format</caption> -->\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Byte</th>\n      <th>Bits</th>\n      <th>Length</th>\n      <th>Field</th>\n      <th>Type</th>\n      <th>Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=2>1</td>\n      <td>1-6</td>\n      <td>6 bits</td>\n      <td>Unknown Field 1a</td>\n      <td></td>\n      <td>Always 0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7-8</td>\n      <td rowspan=2>10 bits</td>\n      <td rowspan=2>Unknown Field 1b</td>\n      <td rowspan=2></td>\n      <td rowspan=2>Same within a chunk.
